Problem
    Salary Calculator
        Basic
        HRA
        DA
        Tax (%)

        Salary = Basic + HRA + DA - Tax(%)

    Assumptions
        1. App meets 100% expectations of the client
            No need for validations
            No need for error messages
        2. The production deployment team will take care of prepare the code for production
            Create .js files
            Create .css files

Incremental
    Create the DOM once
    Manipulate the created DOM everytime the model changes
    May become more imperative

All in One
    Create a new DOM fragment everytime the model changes with the current state of the model
    Can be more declarative

Babel
    Transpiler
    ES6 to ES5

JSX & HTML
    * Open tags without closed tags are allowed in HTML
      Every open tag must have a corresponding close tag in JSX

    * "for" attribute is allowed in HTML
      use "htmlFor" in place of "for" in JSX

    * "class" attribute is allowed in HTML
      use "className" in place of "class" in JSX

Approach
    - Replace JS with a new language
        ex Google Dart

    - Create compilers for other high level languages that will compile to JS
        CoffeeScript
        TypeScript

    - Add more features to JS
        - ES6

Component
    Represents a single UI responsibility that can be reused
    Encapsulates Presentation + UI Behavior + State
    Can be created as a 'Class' / 'function'
